# AZC-Screeps Bot

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.2.0-blue)

**A semi-automated Screeps AI that handles tedious colony management while you retain full strategic control.**

This bot automates spawning, building, mining, resource management, and defense—but leaves expansion, economy, and combat decisions in your hands. Think of it as a **command-and-control interface** rather than a fully autonomous AI.

## 🧪 Test Server

A private Screeps server is included for testing code changes before deploying to production.

```bash
# Start the test server (Docker required)
npm run server:start

# Upload your bot code to the test server
npm run server:upload

# Run syntax checks on all bot files (no dependencies)
npm run test:syntax

# Full test suite (requires npm install)
npm test
```

See [docs/test-server.md](docs/test-server.md) for full documentation.

## 🎮 Philosophy

**You decide**: Which rooms to colonize, where to mine, what to produce, when to attack  
**The bot handles**: Spawning creeps, building structures, mining energy, running factories, defending against invaders

**Result**: You play the strategy game, the bot handles the logistics.
