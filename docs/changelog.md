### Planning Notes
- Multi-shard feature will enable colonies across multiple game shards
- Uses InterShardMemory for cross-shard coordination (100KB per shard)
- Portal-based creep traversal between shards
- Cross-shard colonization, resource sharing, and combat operations
- Development structured in 7 phases
- Will require major refactoring of memory structure (Memory.hive split)
- Target: Version 3.0.0

## [Previous] - Complete Player-Facing Documentation

### Summary
Created comprehensive player-facing documentation for the azc-screeps bot, including a complete `/docs` directory structure, automated GitHub Wiki sync, and updated README with quickstart guide.

### What Was Added

#### Documentation Files (/docs)
1. **index.md** - Landing page with quickstart, TOC, and essential commands
2. **getting-started.md** - Installation, deployment, first-time setup, troubleshooting
3. **driving-the-bot.md** - Core console commands and daily workflows
4. **room-management.md** - RCL progression, spawning logic, population management, recovery scenarios
5. **remote-mining.md** - Planning, setup, SK rooms, optimization strategies
6. **economy-and-market.md** - Factories, labs, terminals, market trading
7. **defense-and-security.md** - Towers, walls, allies, combat operations
8. **performance-and-cpu.md** - Profiling, visual optimization, pulse tuning, caching
9. **configuration.md** - Memory structure, per-room settings, safe defaults
10. **reference-commands.md** - Alphabetical command reference with examples
11. **maintenance-and-debug.md** - Status dashboards, common issues, recovery playbooks
12. **contributing.md** - Development guidelines, PR process, code style

#### Infrastructure
- **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/sync-wiki.yml`):
  - Auto-syncs `/docs` to GitHub Wiki on every push to `main`
  - Renames `index.md` â†’ `Home.md` for wiki compatibility
  - Provides commit summary and wiki link

#### README Updates
- Added "ðŸ“˜ Documentation" section with links to `/docs` and GitHub Wiki
- Added "Player Quickstart" with 5-step getting started guide
- Linked to key documentation pages

### Documentation Philosophy
- **Example-Driven**: Every command includes copy-paste examples and expected outputs
- **Playbook-Based**: End-to-end procedures for common tasks (e.g., set up remote mining, recover from attack)
- **Performance-Focused**: Practical thresholds, profiler recipes, and optimization guidance
- **Cross-Linked**: All pages link to related content for easy navigation
- **Player-First**: Written for human players, assumes comfort with Screeps but new to azc-screeps

### Key Features Documented
- All console commands from `definitions_console_commands.js`
- Memory structure and configuration keys
- Performance controls (`visuals.set_performance()`, `profiler.run()`)
- Status dashboards (`system_status()`, `factory_status()`, `market_status()`)
- Factory production (`factories.set_production()`)
- Lab reactions (`resources.lab_target()`)
- Remote mining workflows
- Defense automation (towers, walls, allies)
- Recovery from disasters (energy depletion, server restart, attacks)

### Concepts Explicitly Documented
- Remote mining workflows and recommended ratios by RCL
- Tower/defense behavior and auto-targeting
- Memory-driven configuration (e.g., `Memory.hive.visuals.update_interval`)
- CPU/pulse frequency tuning and auto-throttling
- Recovery logic around creep population "levels"
- Performance tips and caching patterns
- Recommended ratios of colonies to remote mines by RCL

### Quality Bar
- âœ… All commands have at least one copy-paste example
- âœ… Every page has "When you need this" bullet list
- âœ… Playbooks for key tasks with numbered steps
- âœ… Performance guidance with practical thresholds
- âœ… Safe operations notes and revert instructions
- âœ… Cross-links between related pages
- âœ… Consistent formatting and tone throughout

### Testing & Validation
- All internal links verified
- Code fences use correct syntax highlighting (JavaScript for console, JSON for Memory)
- Examples tested for accuracy against actual console commands
- Structure validated for GitHub Wiki compatibility

### Future Enhancements
Potential future additions:
- Video tutorials or animated GIFs for complex tasks
- Advanced combat strategy guide (expanded from current combat section)
- Multi-room coordination strategies
- Power processing and power creep management
- Highway mining deep dive
- Pixel generation optimization

### Commit Message (Suggested)
