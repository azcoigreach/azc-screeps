- [ ] Add portal route caching
- [ ] Handle portal stability checks
- [ ] Support multiple route options

#### Creep Travel Updates

### Release Strategy
- Each phase merges to `feature/multi-shard`
- Phase 1-3 can be released independently (backwards compatible)
- Phase 4+ require full multi-shard support
- Final merge to `develop`, then `main` after Phase 7

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: After each module creation
- **Integration Tests**: After each phase
- **PTR Testing**: Continuously during development
- **Production Testing**: Staged rollout after Phase 7

## 🎉 Vision: Multi-Shard Future

**By the end of Phase 7, the AZC-Screeps bot will be able to**:

1. **Automatically detect and map** all inter-shard portals
2. **Coordinate operations** across all accessible shards via InterShardMemory
3. **Move creeps seamlessly** between shards through portals
4. **Establish colonies** on any shard with a single console command
5. **Share resources** between shards automatically based on needs
6. **Deploy combat forces** across shards for strategic operations
7. **Monitor and manage** entire multi-shard empire from any shard
8. **Optimize strategy** based on global resource availability

**Result**: A truly multi-shard-capable bot that can dominate the entire Screeps world! 🚀
