## 🚧 Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation

### Phase Goals
1. Refactor memory structure (Memory.hive → Memory.hive + Memory.shard)
2. Create InterShardMemory integration
3. Implement portal detection
4. Test on single shard

### Phase Tasks

#### Memory & ISM
- [ ] Design memory migration function
- [ ] Implement migration function
- [ ] Test migration on PTR
- [ ] Create definitions_intershard_memory.js
- [ ] Implement ISM read/write
- [ ] Test ISM on PTR
- [ ] Review and iterate

#### Portals & Testing

- [ ] Implement portal scanning
- [ ] Test portal detection
- [ ] Update main.js integration
- [ ] Full system test on PTR
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Phase 1 review and sign-off

### Phase Risks
- **High**: Memory migration could break existing functionality

- **Medium**: ISM size could exceed 100KB
  - Mitigation: Implement size monitoring early
- **Low**: Portal detection CPU overhead
  - Mitigation: Use pulse-based scanning

## 🎉 Vision: Multi-Shard Future

**By the end of Phase 7, the AZC-Screeps bot will be able to**:

1. **Automatically detect and map** all inter-shard portals
2. **Coordinate operations** across all accessible shards via InterShardMemory
3. **Move creeps seamlessly** between shards through portals
4. **Establish colonies** on any shard with a single console command
5. **Share resources** between shards automatically based on needs
6. **Deploy combat forces** across shards for strategic operations
7. **Monitor and manage** entire multi-shard empire from any shard
8. **Optimize strategy** based on global resource availability

**Result**: A truly multi-shard-capable bot that can dominate the entire Screeps world! 🚀
